# raffle-matic
A quick script for a lightning talk I never gave for the Salt Lake City Python Meetup group.

I gave my first lightning talk at SLC Python about a couple of custom GUI applications I wrote for the Marriott Library at the University of Utah. It gave me the confidence to begin preparing for another talk, but I was never able to deliver it.

This script is a simple tkinter script to assist in the raffle held at each meeting. The talk centered around an introduction to building simple graphic interfaces for quick Python scripts.
